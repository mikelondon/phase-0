# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# I implemented two methods #my_array_finding_method and #my_hash_finding_method that each take in two parameters.
# The #my_array_finding_method takes in an array(i_want_pets) and a letter ("t") and returns a new array (new_array) of all words containing that letter.
# The #my_hash_finding_method takes in a hash (my_family_pets_ages) and an integer(age) and returns a new array (new_array) of all dogs who are of that age.
# I would recommend writing out pseudocode before writing code - it helps!

def my_array_modification_method!(source, thing_to_modify)
 source.map! do |i|
    if i.is_a? Integer
      i + thing_to_modify

  end
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#
# For the array I used .map, which is basically the destructive
# version of .each. I also used .is_a? to check if the element is
# an integer before doing math on it. Before I had this it was
# turning the non-integer elements to nil.
#
#For the hash method I used .update which is actually made for
# merging hashes as far as I can tell. I'm not sure if using it
# this way is a clever workaround or a crime against good practice.

def my_array_sorting_method(array)

def my_hash_sorting_method(hash)
  p hash.sort_by {|key, value| value}
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# I used the sort_by command which then implemented for both a hash and an array.
# For the Array, I iterated over the elements, selected the elements and converted them to a string.
# For the Hash, I iterated over both the key and value and selected only the values to sort by.



# Person 4
def my_array_deletion_method!(source, thing_to_delete)
  source.delete_if { |x| x.to_s.include? thing_to_delete }
end

def my_hash_deletion_method!(source, thing_to_delete)
  source.delete_if { |x,y| x == thing_to_delete  }
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#
# For the array method I chose to use delete_if method and used include? to check what to delete
#
# For the hash method I used the same delete_if method and set the key in the hash to equal the thing_to_delete

def my_array_splitting_method(source)
  strings, nums = source.partition {|x| x.is_a? String}
  result = [nums] + [strings]
end

def my_hash_splitting_method(source, age)
  young, old = source.partition {|x,y| y < age}
  result = [young] + [old]
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#
# for the array method I decide to split the array into two different arrays.  One for the numbers and one for strings.  I did this using the .partition and .is_a? String method.
#
# For the hash method I split into two arrays by age using the .partion method.


# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.

# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
