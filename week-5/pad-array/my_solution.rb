Were you successful in breaking the problem down into small steps?
  -

Once you had written your pseudocode, were you able to easily translate it into code? What difficulties and successes did you have?
  -

Was your initial solution successful at passing the tests? If so, why do you think that is?
  -

If not, what were the errors you encountered and what did you do to resolve them?
  -

When you refactored, did you find any existing methods in Ruby to clean up your code?
  -

How readable is your solution? Did you and your pair choose descriptive variable names?
  -

What is the difference between destructive and non-destructive methods in your own words?
