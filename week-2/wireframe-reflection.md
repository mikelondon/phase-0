What are the benefits of wireframing?home screen
-A benefit to wireframe is that is gives you the designer the ability to see what you are working with. It will lead to styling the site in a certain way. I think that it will definitely save time when actually writing the code to the website.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
-Yes,  I felt like I was interacting with the naked site with nothing on it. I could design it how I want. I have never felt something like that from just coding some ruby program.  It was a cool feeling. Even though it wasn't like I was coding this website, I was still outlining what I think would look nice.

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
- Yes, I originally did not put my social media links located at the bottom of the home-screen. Before I swapped the location, I had them inside my about me. I also added in the location index at the bottom of the screen.
