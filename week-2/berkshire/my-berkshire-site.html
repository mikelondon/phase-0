<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  - It was overall a great experience! It was so much more excitin than typing some code into codecademy. Don't get me wrong, Codecademy was a great way to get some initial exposure to HTML, but it was so much better to make our own file and keep retrying it in our own browser.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  -We did not use any semenatic HTML5 Elements. I researched semantic HTML5 Elements after finishing this challenge.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  - I think we did pretty good at sticking to the basics, I guess one thing we added into our plain skeleton were the <hr> tags. These tags created the solid lines across the page.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  - The best thing HTML has to offer is how it is a building block for everything. It is the literal skeleton for web pages. Without formatting / styling, Html is very dry and blah. I am extied to learn more about CSS next week and implement them to our web page.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  -Something I have to remember to do is close tags before I type the rest of the tag. On sublime is very easy to complete tags by hitting TAB, but on the colaborator I was having trouble remembering to close tags. I do not have any tricks, maybe I should look some up to help me.
