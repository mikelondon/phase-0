### Answer the following questions:

What is a one-to-one database?
  *  A one to one database is a connection between two tables where each have one connection that is uniquely related. In the example above the person table is linked to the gamer tag table though an ID field. this is a one time connection between the two tables.
When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
  *You would use a one to one relationship when keeping your databases clean and easily readable. It cleans up the look of the main table.
What is a many-to-many database?
  *  In the example above the grocery list id is linked to the grocery list table not the product table and the product id is linked to the product table. This is two instances of a one to one database, but when looking at it from a whole it is one large many to many database.
When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
  *  You would use a many to many database when you have a table which could have smaller tables inside that relate back to the main general table. It can get very complex very fast.
What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
  * I think they can get convoluted very fast so it makes sense to approach them in small steps and plan out how you want to display the tables.
